# React Weather App

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
\
This is a simple weather app which gets and displays a 5-day forecast. The default location is Edinburgh but can be changed by searching for another town or city in the UK.\
\
Click the 'More Details' button to show or hide additional weather info for a selected day.
